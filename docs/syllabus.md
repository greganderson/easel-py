# Syllabus

The syllabus should be in `syllabus.md` in the root of your course directory.
Notice that this is a markdown file unlike the other components which are
specified with yaml. The markdown text will be converted to html when pushed to
Canvas. You may specify the default course landing page using the course
settings component.
